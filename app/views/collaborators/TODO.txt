* Space owners / admins should not be given commit access by default.  When the space is created
  add the owner as a collaborator.  When an admin is created add them as a collaborator.  However,
  it should be possible to remove them from the collaborators list.

* Rename collaborators to 'team members'

* Add ability to create "team groups' so permissions can be given to a group instead of having to
  always specify each person individually.
