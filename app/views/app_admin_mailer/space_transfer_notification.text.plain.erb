Hi <%= h(@admin.full_name) %>,

The  user [<%= h(@user.full_name) %>] has been deactivated and the following spaces have
been transfered to you:

<% @spaces.each do |s| %>
* <%= h(s.name) %>
<% end %>

You may want to try contacting one of the space administrators and see if you can transfer
the space(s) to them.
